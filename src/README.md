## project initialization

- Created this website using create-react-app, it provides a more structured and predefined configuration. It abstracts away a lot of the underlying tooling and configuration, making it easier for beginners to get started. but with less flexibility compared to Vite

- Vite would be my starting point for the next react projects typically because it focuses on providing a fast development experience by leveraging native ES modules in modern browsers

note that vite is much better for small project ideally single page web app.

## src

- src/: This is the main folder where I wrote my React application code. It contains the following files

- index.css: contains gradients
- index.js: It renders the root component of the application into the DOM.
- App.js: The main container for the application.
- App.css: The default CSS file for styling the App component.
